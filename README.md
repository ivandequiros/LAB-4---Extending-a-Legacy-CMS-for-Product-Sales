# LAB 4 - Extending a Legacy CMS for Product Sales

This GitHub repository features a specialized extension of a legacy Content Management System (CMS) designed using PHP and MySQL. While the frontend is crafted using Bootstrap, this project specifically introduces a functional e-commerce module, including a shopping cart and checkout system.

One of the key highlights of this lab is the integration of the Mailtrap API to provide automated email confirmations for customer orders. The system has been extended with new database relationships in the `orders` and `order_items` tables to handle product sales efficiently.

Overall, this CMS demonstrates the ability to scale a legacy monolithic application by adding modern e-commerce features and automated communication services.
